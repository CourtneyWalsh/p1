		<h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
		<p>I am a self-taught web designer and small business owner. I design websites for other mom-and-pop shops across the country. I graduated college with three degrees, English-Writing, Studio Art-Photography, and Studio Art-Graphic Design. There were no computer science courses offered at the small liberal arts college I attended so I started teaching myself through online courses and tutorials, which led to internships working in the industry, which is how I eventually decided that is what I wanted to do. </p>
		
		<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
		<p>I am taking this course because I am pretty well versed in HTML, CSS, and know a decent amount of JavaScript but like the description said I am looking to take my web programming skills to the next level with server-side web development. </p>
		
		<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
		<p>I have very little experience in programming. I took CS50 last semester, which was pretty much the first time I experienced any coding outside of web design basics. I am eager to learn anything and everything I can. </p>
		
		<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
		<p>I work on a Macbook Pro. </p>
		
		<h2>Some Interesting Facts About Me</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>My husband’s last name is Courtney, so when I get around to changing my name it will be Courtney Courtney.</li> 
		<li>I am incredibly curious and absorb information like a sponge.</li>
		<li>I love animals and am an extremely active member in PETA and the Humane Society. My two rescued dogs are pictured above, on the left is Vader a Husky/German Shepherd and on the right is Hans an Australian Shepherd/Black Lab. With the exception of class and restaurants I rarely go anywhere without them.</li>  
		<li>If you couldn't tell by my dog's names, I am obsessed with all that is Star Wars. I am not overly optimistic about the future Disney movies though.</li> 
		<li>I just moved to Boston Sept 1st from Michigan. The only real reason being that My husband and I love to travel. We have lived in 12 different houses and been to 11 different countries since we started dating in 2009. Because I do web design from wherever my computer is and he is a Petroleum Geologist traveling to different oilrigs every month we’ve never felt the need to stay put. We’re thinking Texas or Colorado next. </li>
